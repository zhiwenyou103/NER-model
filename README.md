#### Composition of the project
- main program - trains and tests the model, calls methods in other programs.
- model program - set model parameters, build models, including CNN, CRF and word vector creation.
- Other programs - data preprocessing functions, format conversion functions, data loading functions, etc.
- Datasets - including Chinese and English datasets.
